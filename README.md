# Advent of Code 2023 - tizu

watch my crappy code fail as I solve each day's puzzle.

## NOTES

- I'm targeting the first puzzle, I also got other stuff to do. Unless it's a simple 2 minute fix, I'm not doing the second one.
- My code is pretty crappy, I'm just trying to solve it and make it readable (to some extent).

## RUN

The `go` command is required to build and run the code. Run `go run .` while in the git repo directory to run the code.

- `go run . 2`: Run the code for day 2, part 1
- `go run . 6 -2`: Run the code for day 6, part 2
- `go run . 2 --no-verbose`: Run the code for day 2 without verbose logging
- `go run . 6 -f example`: Read from example.txt instead
- `go run . 2 -e 3`: Shows your expected output below the answer
