# Advent of Code 2023 - tizu

watch my crappy code fail as I solve each day's puzzle.

## NOTES

- I'm targeting the first puzzle, I also got other stuff to do. Unless it's a simple 2 minute fix, I'm not doing the second one.
- My code is pretty crappy, I'm just trying to solve it and make it readable (to some extent).
